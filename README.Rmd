# circle

R client package for the Circle CI REST API

# Deployment

The easiest way to get deployment from Circle CI builds to Github repos running is by using `use_circle_deploy()`:

```r
❯ Adding deploy keys on GitHub and Circle CI for repo '<repo>'.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Added a public deploy key to GitHub for '<repo>'.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Added a private deploy key to project '<repo>' on Circle CI as secure environment variable 'id_rsa'.
```

## Deployment keys

There two different types of keys on Circle CI: 

- Checkout keys

- SSH keys

### Checkout keys

Checkout keys are used to checkout your repository so that the build is starting.
If you've connected Circle CI to Github already, you will have a "deploy key" stored in every repository to be able to checkout the code.

However, this key does not have enough permissions to also deploy from builds.
To enable this, a "github-user-key" is needed. 
This key is added when calling `use_circle_deploy()`.

### SSH keys

The private key will be added to your repo setting on Circle CI while the public key will be stored as a "deploy key" in your repository on Github.

If you do not want to use `use_circle_deploy()` and go the manual way of adding a SSH key to Circle CI, please be aware of [this issue](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/adding-ssh-keys-fails/7747).
