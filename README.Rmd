# circle

R client package for the Circle CI REST API

Most functionality is tailored towards the Circle CI [API v2](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs) which follows the 

**pipelines** -> **workflows** -> **jobs**

approach

Most functions have already been ported to the new API v2.
The only function which is still running via API v1.1 is `enable_repo()` since no v2 equivalent exists for this function yet.

If you want to get more information, have a look at the [document explaining changes between v1.1 and v2.](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/api-changes.md#endpoints-likely-being-removed-in-api-v2-still-available-in-v11-for-now).

## Installation

Development Version:

```r
remotes::install_github("ropenscilabs/circle")
