# circle

R client package for the Circle CI REST API

# Deployment

The easiest way to get deployment from Circle CI builds to Github repos running is by using `use_circle_deploy()`:

```r
❯ Adding deploy keys on GitHub and Circle CI for repo '<repo>'.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Added a public deploy key to GitHub for '<repo>'.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✔ Added a private deploy key to project '<repo>' on Circle CI as secure environment variable 'id_rsa'.
```

## Deployment keys

There two different types of keys on Circle CI: 

- Checkout keys

- SSH keys

### Checkout keys

The former are used to checkout your repository so that the build is starting.
If you've connected Circle CI to Github already, you will have a "deploy key" stored in every repository to be able to checkout the code.

There is no advantage in adding a "github-user-key" to the checkout section. 
This key would not give you any more rights regarding deployment.

### SSH keys

These are actually used to grant deployment access from the build to your repository.
The private key will be added to your repo setting on Circle CI while the public key will be stored as a "deploy key" in your repository on Github.

If you do not want to use `use_circle_deploy()` and go the manual way of adding a SSH key to Circle CI, please be aware of [this issue](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/adding-ssh-keys-fails/7747).
