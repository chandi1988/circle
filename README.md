# circle

R client package for the Circle CI REST API

Most functionality is tailored towards the Circle CI [API
v2](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs) which follows
the

pipelines -\> workflows -\> jobs

principle.

Some functions use endpoints from the v1.1 API (e.g.Â `enable_repo()`)
because these endpoints do not yet work with the v2 API. Some are also
about to be removed soon [according to the Circle CI
team](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/blob/master/docs/api-changes.md#endpoints-likely-being-removed-in-api-v2-still-available-in-v11-for-now).

## Get Started

See the [Getting
Started](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/circle/articles/circle.html)
vignette for an introduction.
